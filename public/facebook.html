<article>
    <p>In light of recent news, I wish deleting Facebook profiles was enough.</p>
<p><strong>In two sentences</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The free online tools we rely on are being used to divide and conquer our
sources of information and our understanding of current events via methods
once considered the purview of military psychological operations.<sup id="fnref3-Psyops"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-Psyops" id="generated-link-id0">1</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What we buy, what we share online, what we think about, how we 
feel<sup id="fnref-Contagion"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-Contagion" id="generated-link-id1">2</a></sup>, and how we voice our opinions are being tracked and 
manipulated to drive this process towards a future where intellectual liberty 
and individual agency are increasingly illusory.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>While it’s easiest to talk about Facebook at the moment, the real problems are 
structural and much more significant than a single company:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Companies like Google, Facebook, Palantir, and Amazon are encouraged to build
  increasingly detailed datasets and sophisticated behavioral models of our 
  society. Both self-interest and national security dictate that many insights
  are withheld from the public, quietly used to extend and consolidate power,
  and further monetized by offerings of targeted messaging or outright
  surveillance as a service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our attention has become a precious and rationed commodity.<sup id="fnref-Attention"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-Attention" id="generated-link-id2">3</a></sup> As we
  are besought on all fronts by advertising, directed messaging, and our own 
  needs to be heard by each other, viewership must be solicited by viral 
  exploitation of human psychology - sometimes in tragic and destructive ways, 
  such as acts of terrorism.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The government agencies we depend on to reconcile corporate incentives with 
  our social values have been captured by corporations.<sup id="fnref3-Regulations"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-Regulations" id="generated-link-id3">4</a></sup> 
  Meanwhile, we lack confidence in our political leaders to challenge existing
  power or to restrain government use of this apparatus<sup id="fnref2-Psyops"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-Psyops" id="generated-link-id4">1</a></sup> from ends 
  immiscible with our core values as a people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We the people are divided, largely deprived of awareness, and increasingly
  dependent on the very system which has begun our subjugation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Our future has started to look more like a dystopian episode of “Black Mirror”
than even some of the creators of these tools wanted to consider or believe. The
undercurrents are subtle, abstract, and global.</p>
<p>As the scope of the problem becomes more apparent, we are realizing that
extricating ourselves from our current situation is absolutely imperative.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I feel tremendous guilt. …  I think we have created tools that are ripping 
apart the social fabric of how society works. That is truly where we are. … 
The short-term, dopamine-driven feedback-loops that we have created are 
destroying how society works. No civil discourse. No cooperation. 
Misinformation. Mistruth.</p>
<p>And it’s not an American problem. This is not about Russian ads. This is a 
global problem. So, we’re in a really bad state of affairs right now, in my 
opinion. It is eroding the core foundations of how people behave by and 
between each other.</p>
<p>Um, and I don’t have a good solution. You know, my solution is I just don’t 
use these tools anymore.</p>

<p>Our adoption of social media and free, data-driven services did not happen 
overnight, but it has transformed our society in significant ways. The feedback 
mechanisms at play are not secret, but they are poorly popularized. Readers who 
wish to review the rise of social media, its effects on our online transactions,
and its role in surveillance are encouraged to continue reading this section, 
while those familiar with the importance of ad-based revenue, user addiction, 
viral content, and the security implications may wish to skip to

<h2 id="we-are-the-product">We are the Product<a class="headerlink" href="#we-are-the-product" id="generated-link-id30" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>We’ve long recognized that Facebook is free because <em>we are the product</em>. We 
give up our privacy on the platform and allow Facebook to sell information about
us to advertisers for directing marketing campaigns. This is nothing new, 
nor is it secret.<sup id="fnref-FacebookAds"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-FacebookAds" id="generated-link-id31">7</a></sup></p>

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This issue is usually discussed as one of privacy vs discretion. Nobody <em>forces</em>
you to disclose personal information online; we <em>choose</em> to do so when the 
benefits outweigh the consequences.</p>
<p>And there <em>are</em> some benefits - even the targeted marketing looks good on paper:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We discover music, books, films, and products which fit our expressed tastes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Advertisers can operate more efficiently (Tampax need not advertise to men,
   for example).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We build communities we share interests with, connect to each other in new
   ways, and can spread ideas more effectively than ever before. We feel
   unseparated by physical distances and enriched by our engagement.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This seems like a three-way winning scenario: for us, for Facebook, and for 
advertisers.</p>
<p><strong>Spoiler:</strong> We lose.</p>
<p>The problem is that there are socially undesirable incentives for social media 
platforms which exploit natural human drives, create corrosive feedback loops,
and wield power few of us thought technically possible.</p>
<h2 id="engineered-addiction">Engineered Addiction<a class="headerlink" href="#engineered-addiction" id="generated-link-id33" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>As an advertising platform, the more you interact with Facebook, the more 
opportunity for the site to serve you ads. That same interaction also provides 
more value to the company through a higher volume of collected personal data:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The incentives created by an advertising business model are to essentially 
addict people psychologically to your product… They spend more time on the
site and see more ads. They’re just more valuable to them.</p>
<p>– Roger McNamee (one of Facebook’s original investors)<sup id="fnref-PBS"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-PBS" id="generated-link-id34">9</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>One way to literally addict you to the platform is by exploiting our human need
for social validation. By treating our online profiles as extensions of our
public image, we are encouraged to share and post content to receive feedback as
likes and comments.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The thought process that went into building these applications, Facebook being
the first of them, … was all about: ‘How do we consume as much of your time 
and conscious attention as possible?’ … And that means that we need to sort 
of give you a little dopamine hit every once in a while, because someone 
liked or commented on a photo or a post or whatever. And that’s going to get 
you to contribute more content … It’s a social-validation feedback loop 
… you’re exploiting a vulnerability in human psychology. The inventors …
understood this consciously. And we did it anyway.</p>
<p>– Sean Parker (First President of Facebook)<sup id="fnref-Axios"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-Axios" id="generated-link-id35">10</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a consequence of this social feedback system, our own incentives lead us to 
misrepresent our lives, warping both our own self-image and our sense of 
self-worth. When each of us ensures that we will only be seen from our favorite 
angles, the converse is that judging ourselves against social media profiles
amounts to comparing ourselves to fiction.</p>
<p>The need for social approval we seek on Facebook also distorts our valuation of
the environment around us. Life experiences should not be measured in likes, and
yet we find ourselves adjusting our plans and activities in response to this 
feedback system. How many precious moments do we reduce to selfie opportunities?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We curate our lives around this perceived sense of perfection because we get 
rewarded in these short-term signals - hearts, likes, thumb’s up - and we 
conflate that with value and we conflate it with truth. And instead what it 
really is is fake, brittle popularity that’s short-term and that leaves you 
even more – and admit it – vacant and empty.</p>

<h2 id="the-perversion-of-content-creation">The Perversion of Content Creation<a class="headerlink" href="#the-perversion-of-content-creation" id="generated-link-id37" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>While companies like Facebook were constructed to appeal to our vanity and our 
need for approval, content itself is useful for addicting users. It makes 
matters worse that content creators are themselves dependent on ad revenue and 
must also solicit shares, views, and clicks by exploiting our psychology. This 
spawns the typical click-bait articles and sensational headlines, but it also 
singles out other specific patterns:</p>
<p>The content and memes that go viral - reproducing through our shares, upvotes, 
and reposts - are reflections of the selective pressures our emotional reactions
exert on content.<sup id="fnref-Selection"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-Selection" id="generated-link-id38">11</a></sup> The analogy to genetic evolution is deep and 
well-established.<sup id="fnref-Memes"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-Memes" id="generated-link-id39">13</a></sup> As a consequence, when the feedback mechanism goes
awry - such as allowing young children to repeatedly select Youtube views - so 
too does the content.<sup id="fnref-Elsagate"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-Elsagate" id="generated-link-id40">14</a></sup>,<sup id="fnref-Dogs"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-Dogs" id="generated-link-id41">15</a></sup></p>
<p>As we vie alongside companies for each other’s increasingly besought attention
and content is driven to extremes, less of our time is invested reading 
articles or focusing on the complexities of any given issue: Our perceptions are
shaped by the headlines and images alone, and we conclude that the world is
going crazy. We react to misleading stories without evaluating context, bias, or
source material. Worse, we actively spread such content.</p>
<p><strong><em>For political ends, the most effective content plays to our fears and 
outrage.</em></strong><sup id="fnref-Vice"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-Vice" id="generated-link-id42">16</a></sup>,<sup id="fnref-Guardian"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-Guardian" id="generated-link-id43">17</a></sup> This is not, as Roger Stone would explain it, 
because “Hate is a stronger motivator than love”.<sup id="fnref-GetMeRogerStone"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-GetMeRogerStone" id="generated-link-id44">18</a></sup> Quite the 
opposite: We alert our communities to perceived threats to our survival. As with
many animals, human society depends on such behavior.</p>
<p>This flavor of fear-inducing and hateful messaging in times of power struggle is
not new. The nature of propaganda in virtually every war reflects this, as do 
historical political pamphlets, newspapers,<sup id="fnref-Newspaper"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-Newspaper" id="generated-link-id45">19</a></sup> radio,<sup id="fnref-Radio"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-Radio" id="generated-link-id46">20</a></sup> and 
television.<sup id="fnref-Television"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-Television" id="generated-link-id47">21</a></sup> <strong><em>What is new is the ability to target this messaging 
with laser precision.</em></strong> Throughout the 21st century, our media will be 
increasingly individualized and capable of responding in near real-time to our 
thoughts and actions - a data-driven battlefield for our minds where the powers 
that be wage war.</p>
<p>US Intelligence noticed.</p>
<h2 id="accepting-global-surveillance">Accepting Global Surveillance<a class="headerlink" href="#accepting-global-surveillance" id="generated-link-id48" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>In the cost-benefit analysis of originally joining Facebook or using Google,
few of us understood the ramifications. <em>(Hey! Free stuff!)</em> We did not 
appreciate that the personal information we surrendered included all of our
social connections, messages, searches, posts, images, videos, emails, location
history, group affiliations, and everything we’ve ever clicked on through the
platform … nor what this information really entailed … nor who had access.</p>
<p>In 2013, Facebook was revealed as a participant in the PRISM government 
surveillance program through documents leaked by Edward Snowden.<sup id="fnref-PRISM"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-PRISM" id="generated-link-id49">22</a></sup>,
<sup id="fnref-Snowden"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-Snowden" id="generated-link-id50">23</a></sup></p>
<p>This should have changed the calculus.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Businesses that make money by collecting and selling detailed records of 
private lives were once plainly described as “surveillance companies.” Their 
rebranding as “social media” is the most successful deception since the 
Department of War became the Department of Defense.</p>
<p>– Edward Snowden<sup id="fnref3-Snowden"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-Snowden" id="generated-link-id51">23</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>While some people abandoned ship in the wake of this revelation, the rest of us 
collectively adapted to the new information, adopting the conclusion that only 
criminals, perverts, and terrorists should be concerned. We convinced ourselves 
that no True American<sup id="fnref-TrueScotsman"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-TrueScotsman" id="generated-link-id52">24</a></sup> need fear, putting our faith in the legal
protections extended to our information<sup id="fnref-LegalProtections"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-LegalProtections" id="generated-link-id53">25</a></sup> and accepting that 
this was the price we must pay for safety against terrorism.<sup id="fnref-FearTerrorism"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-FearTerrorism" id="generated-link-id54">26</a></sup></p>
<p>In truth, these were rationalizations for inconvenient and uncomfortable 
facts<sup id="fnref-Rationalization"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-Rationalization" id="generated-link-id55">27</a></sup>… rationalizations we continue to return to after
each successive alarm.<sup id="fnref-NothingToHide"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-NothingToHide" id="generated-link-id56">28</a></sup></p>
<p>We might have all prefered a world in which we left social media en masse or
migrated to alternative platforms, but each of us was disincentivized from

<p>Starting in late 2012, Dr. Kosinski (then at MIT) was able to show that 
   knowing a relatively small number of a Facebook user’s “likes” proved 
   sufficient to accurately guess not only an individual’s demographic 
   information (including “sexual orientation, ethnicity, religious and 
   political views, personality traits, intelligence, happiness, use of 
   addictive substances, parental separation, age, and gender”), but 
   psychometric classification as well. <sup id="fnref-KosinskiLikes"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-KosinskiLikes" id="generated-link-id61">31</a></sup>,<sup id="fnref3-Vice"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-Vice" id="generated-link-id62">16</a></sup>,<sup id="fnref4-Guardian"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-Guardian" id="generated-link-id63">17</a></sup>

<p>Our collected communications are not merely a record of things we have said.
   It is possible to discriminate between the possible authors of a piece of

   information is technically capable of being used to mimic or misattribute 
   authorship.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is a wider category of <em>behavioral</em> patterns (which includes 
   productive style as discussed above) that can be recreated from logged 
   data and used to identify individuals. This includes (but is not limited to)
   the way we walk and move, our response to directed stimuli, and even the

<p>As we continue to discover that certain sets of behaviors and attributes

environment: Facebook can recognize your face in the photos of others even if 
you’ve removed yourself from the platform. Google can guess at our friendships 
– and whom we sleep with – based on the correlated GPS traces of our phones.</p>
<p>The vectors by which we expose ourselves are multiplying. Into a world awash

<p>Access to information amounts to a more complete and detailed understanding of 
the world. The ability to extract this information from unexpected patterns in 
data reveals arbitrage opportunities, creates tactical advantages, provides for 
optimized business decisions, improves operational efficiency, and allows the 
automation of tasks which may have never before been possible.</p>
<p>It is instructive to consider that (despite the buzzwords and the hype) our 
recent visible advances in “artificial intelligence” have not been due to 
fundamental technical breakthroughs but rather increases in computing power and
the accumulation of <em>massive datasets</em>.<sup id="fnref-AI"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-AI" id="generated-link-id77">43</a></sup> To address AI: our fear of

<p><strong>The vast quantity of data we produce and its restriction to only a few
hands is the entire problem.</strong> The producers and subjects of this data (i.e. us)
typically have access to none of it. This creates an information asymmetry which

<p>As of the end of 2017, Facebook had expanded to over two billion monthly users,
75% of which are outside of the USA and Europe. As nations have been forced to 
wrestle with the company for sovereignty over information channels, the 
bargaining chips are censorship, surveillance, anti-competitive practices, and 
the benefits of having a connected populace. Varying degrees of capitulation in
